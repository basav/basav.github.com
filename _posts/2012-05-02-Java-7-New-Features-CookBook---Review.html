<br /><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/java-7-new-features-cookbook/book">Java 7 New Features CookBook</a> by <b>Richard M. Reese</b> and <b>Jennifer L. Reese</b> is a good read but could have been better.&nbsp;As the name suggests this is a cook book containing recipes describing new Java 7 features.<br />Java SE 7 (or Java 1.7) was released in July 2011.<br /><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdk7-relnotes-418459.html#changes">Lots of features</a> have been introduced in Java 7 and the authors have covered most of them.<br /><br />The target audience of this book are experienced Java developers who are familiar with writing programs in Java 5 and beyond and not for newbies to Java.&nbsp;Most of the recipes revolve around I/O i.e. File, Paths , Streams concurrency - which means a previous knowledge of these concepts are essential.<br /><br /><b>What's good:</b><br />The book contains 11 chapters:<br />covering core language improvements like using String in switch, using the diamond operator for constructor type inference etc, <span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;</span>to various recipes related to Java I/O,<span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;</span>to GUI improvements, event handling&nbsp;to JDBC enhancements.<br />Each recipe follows a standard structure describing how to grasp the concept thru code. It is not necessary to read from start to end, the reader can jump into any recipe and read it.<br />Also most recipes includes <b>caveats</b> and <b>gotchas</b> which are immensely helpful for the developer.<br /><br /><b>What could have been improved:</b><br />Code examples are very basic. The authors could have taken better interesting examples to illustrate the concepts.<br /><b>The code blocks are not reader friendly. The font, the formatting etc is sub-standard</b>. This is the crux of the recipe and developers hate to see their code badly formatted.<br />Examples could have been less&nbsp;repetitive. Seems like the authors were in a hurry to release the book :)<br /><br /><b>What's missing:</b><br />A little bit history on Java versions. This helps readers to refresh the memory and sets some context.<br />Something on RIA Deployment toolkit, Custom classloaders, Garbage collector etc<br /><br /><b>Conclusion:</b><br />Easy to read and understand. Worth picking up. &nbsp;Highly recommended for someone who wants most of the new features in Java 7 in one place with code examples.<br /><br />Thanks for reading..<br /><br /><div><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9675872-5982499181687839885?l=bnagur.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
