My stint with <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/togaf/"><span style="color: blue;">TOGAF™ 9</span></a> (by<span style="color: blue;"> </span><a href="http://www.opengroup.org/" style="color: blue;">Open Group</a>) architecture started today. I'm attending a 5 Day full time classroom training course on TOGAF™ 9. Day 1 got over today. It was little taxing to sit thru for almost 9 hours on first day. I don't blame the instructor - he has lots to cover - moreover he made it really interesting answering many questions - even vague and stupid questions from audience. It is just that am lost touch with these full day trainings'. He encouraged lots of participation and quoted good examples from his experience and learning.<br /><br />TOGAF™ defines a methodology as well as a framework for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture"><span style="color: blue;">Enterprise Architecture</span></a>. It is interesting to know that the first version of TOGAF™ came out in 1995 and was based on the US Department of Defense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Architecture_Framework_for_Information_Management" style="color: blue;">Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM)</a>. It has gone thru multiple revisions and recently in 2009 - TOGAF™ 9 version was released. Check out the Wikipedia link - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework"><span style="color: blue;">gives a good brief overview</span></a>.<br /><br />Today the focus was more on <b>Introduction</b>, <b>Why Enterprise Architecture</b>? <b>Why TOGAF™</b>? and good introduction on <b>TOGAF™ ADM framework </b>and its phases (below image). TOGAF™ ADM is the heart and soul of TOGAF™ 9 methodology.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QPXuC0QjmW4/TonXL5DzKQI/AAAAAAAAAek/PRs9iAPw0us/s1600/TOGAF+9+Architecture+Development+Method.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QPXuC0QjmW4/TonXL5DzKQI/AAAAAAAAAek/PRs9iAPw0us/s400/TOGAF+9+Architecture+Development+Method.jpg" width="303" /></a></div><br />Until next time.. i.e. tomm<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9675872-6788432654647673416?l=bnagur.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
