		<p> <b>Happy Holi folks ! </b></p>

	<p> It has been a while that I have updated the blog. Its probably lack of time :) also more of procastination. </p>

<p> Anyway, past couple of months have been eventful. Workwise I was busy - but otherwise also there were few interesting stuff. </p>

<p> I happen to attend the <a href="http://2013.agileindia.org/">Agile India 2013 Conference </a> for couple of days. I attended the Technical track. Experience was so-so. Could have been better. As usual - great keynotes by <a href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s">Venkat</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neal4d">Neal</a>. I really enjoyed <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/how4q44dzitn0sg/Kevlin%20Henney%20-%20Driven%20to%20Tests.pdf">"Driven To Tests" </a>session by <a href="https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney">Kevlin Henney</a>. Absolute fantastic sessions by <a href="https://twitter.com/henrikkniberg">Henrik Kniberg</a>. Very helpful with lots of practical tips improving the existing process and become more agile. In future - if you get a chance then please don't miss Henrik's <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/32yoe92e714jivn/Henrik%20Kniberg%20-%20Everybody%20wants%20Change%2C%20but%20nobody%20likes%20to%20Be%20Changed.pdf"> Everybody Wants Change, but Nobody Likes to Be Changed </a>. Super helpful.

Key takeaways (what I can remember :-) )
</p>
<ul>
<li> Functional programming is the in-thing. </li>
<li> Writing better quality code has become even more important. </li>
<li> Doing TDD (Think/Test Driven Development) is an art and it comes by experience.</li>
<li> What works from somebody or someteam might not work for you. Experiment and improvise </li>
<li> Taking risks is good. The greatest risk is not taking risk.</li>
<li> Estimations are always made up numbers. </li>
<li>etc</li>
</li>
</ul>

<b>Good news.</b> I and (few of my colllegues) caught up with Venkat after one of his talks, invited to spend a day with us. He readily agreed. <b>#super-excited</b>. The event is planned on a Saturday (April 13th) at AppDev GGN and the agenda looks great - Will keep posted.

We also conducted <b>Developer Days</b> in the office (March 8th). Developer days are for developers :) - start the day with breakfast and end the day with beer in the evening. No project work, no meetings <b> #joy </b></p>

<p>It is fatastic to hear fellow developers speak and share on latest technologies (Node, Angular, HTML5 offline, Rubymotion, Clojure etc). I really enjoyed it.  By the way, I presented on the Clojure - a short intro to stir the interest in Clojure. Here are the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rajanagur/clojure-intro-17845382">slides</a>. </p>

<b>More Good news.</b>. One more agile conference. This one by AppDev. My dear collegues in office conducted an Agile conference- <a href="http://www.being-agile.com/"> Being Agile 2013 </a>. 
Lots of effort was put in making this an successful event. External speakers + Internal speakers made it super awesome. 
Do checkout the <a href="http://www.being-agile.com/index.php/the-conference/agenda"> agenda</a>.

Firm IT AppDev is one kind of large start-up. Great folks to work with, great technology options, great leadership team. <b>#happy-to-be-here </b>
</p>
<p>Last but not least - I was in Jakarta for half a week on a business visit. Meeting new client. My first trip to 
Indonesia. It is pretty hot and crowded place. I enjoyed my stay  </p>

<p><b>Until next time...</b></p>
