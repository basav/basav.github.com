At my work, there was a need to develop the same application for three different platforms - .NET, LAMP and for Java.&nbsp; I was asked to pick a framework to develop this app in Java. It was easy for my other colleagues for .NET and LAMP as there was not much choice - ASP.NET was picked for .NET and Ruby on Rails for the LAMP stack.<br />When it comes to Java, I need not say more, there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Web_application_frameworks#Java">tons of choices.</a> Burden of Choice.&nbsp; <br />The objectives were clear -<br /><ul><li>Rapid development (code - deploy - test cycle)</li><li>Deployable on popular Web/App servers (Apache Tomcat, JBoss, Oracle, Websphere etc)</li><li>Deployable on the cloud</li><li>Best engineering practices (unit testing, functional testing, clean code)</li></ul>My friend suggested that I don't have much choice - it has to be either Spring or Groovy on Grails.&nbsp;<br /><br />Spring has kind of become the de-facto standard for enterprises, followed by JBoss SEAM.<br />I have a good experience with Spring and have been an early adopter of this great framework. Spring became popular because of the pit-falls of EJB2 and heavyweight runtime.<br /><br />But over the past few releases, Spring has grown to be a huge framework. It takes a lifetime to be familiar with all the modules of the Spring and the features it supports.&nbsp; Recent times - <b>Spring is over-engineered, over-complicated and feature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">creep</a>.</b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep"> </a><br />&nbsp; <br />With JBoss SEAM stack, you cannot avoid JSF. I never learnt JSF and would never learn it. There is already <a href="http://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2009/05/15/jsf-sucks/">enough rants</a> on the web about the design flaws of JSF. <br /><br />Spring Roo is another great tool to improve the developer productivity but again it's not straightforward. It involves GWT, Spring. Maven etc. Too much. All goes well for a trival hello-world or a simple CRUD app, the moment you try to do a little more complex web-app, things start falling apart.<br /><br />No doubt these are great frameworks, but I wanted to avoid maven and its pom file nightmares, classpath issues, layers and layers of abstraction, enforced rules,&nbsp; high learning curve etc.<br /><br />Enter <a href="http://www.playframework.org/">Play framework </a>!<br /><br />I'm not advocating this is one of the best frameworks, but it truly matches the productivity of RoR, low learning curve, stateless architecture i.e. made for cloud, dramatically reduces the develop/test/deploy cycle, borrows the best things from RoR, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">DJango</a> and still retaining the best things about Java (rock solid,  enterprise&nbsp;strength&nbsp;scalability&nbsp;and security, great external libraries  and developer community etc.).<br /><br />It has been already a month I'm using this great framework and I must say it has been a very memorable experience.<br />In my next post, I would be giving some nifty features of this framework and more insights<br /><br />Until next time ..<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9675872-2539605712833717371?l=bnagur.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
