The final nomination list is out of the opensource software on the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home">Packt website</a>.<br /><br />Whats interesting is <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> has gained lot of prominence in last few months. Its a strong contender on the <b>Open Source Mobile Toolkits and Libraries</b>.<br /><br />The other section which I always keep an watch is <b>Most Promising Open Source Project</b>. PHP rules the web - there are couple of php related frameworks. There one which I like most is the <a href="http://www.impresspages.org/">Impress Pages </a> - its looks very promising and a very great content management software. Worth downloading and playing with it. <br /><br />Please visit the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home">awards home page</a> and vote your favorite one. I just finished voting.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9675872-3038913630777383386?l=bnagur.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
