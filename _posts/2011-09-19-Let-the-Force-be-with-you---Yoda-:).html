Created a Salesforce developer account. Completed a simple cookbook example. No coding yet,&nbsp; most of it from the developer portal, using mouse and clicking to create apps and entering label values.<br /><br />Everything is controlled on the platform - database tables (called as Custom Objects in Salesforce language),&nbsp; form creation etc. Prima facie the tool looks like it targets Business users to create basic enterprise apps. <br />All the development happens on the Web page (no IDE required). Also there is an Eclipse plugin available to do the development.<br /><br />The programming language is Apex (predominantly Java syntax) but the code gets compiled to a meta-data which gets interpreted by Apex runtime.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dUNjE2xdZk4/Tnc5Quxh21I/AAAAAAAAAeE/RGY37Nqq_ZY/s1600/apex_architecture.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dUNjE2xdZk4/Tnc5Quxh21I/AAAAAAAAAeE/RGY37Nqq_ZY/s640/apex_architecture.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />Apps created on SalesForce are completely data-driven and tightly integrated with Data. You can create apps and share with others as well as use any of the available apps on the platform (provided you have rights).&nbsp; Common enterprise services like user management, file upload, reports, search etc are available and usable without any customization.<br />Its easy to get started and the developer account is free, <a href="http://www.developerforce.com/events/regular/registration.php">register here.</a><br />The example which I tried is <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/workbook/index.htm">Warehouse example</a>. <br />Some basics and fundamentals of the platform are <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/fundamentals/index.htm">here</a>, which I have started going thru it.<br />I have just spent 1 hr and it was fairly easy to try out hands on the Force platform.&nbsp; <br />I have barely scratched the surface ...will keep exploring it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9675872-5001856273941571384?l=bnagur.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
