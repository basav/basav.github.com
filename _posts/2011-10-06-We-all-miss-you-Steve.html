I woke up today with very sad news to find out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs" style="color: #cc0000;">Steve Jobs</a> is no more. I feel so bad- I cannot comprehend how <b><a href="http://www.apple.com/" style="color: blue;">Apple</a></b> employees and his family might be going thru. People out there who use Apple products kind of feel connected with Steve - some kind of a <span style="color: #741b47;"><b>spiritual</b> </span>connection. He has put his soul into the products, his company.&nbsp; He <b style="color: purple;">devoted</b> his complete professional and creative life to this world by giving out-of-the-world products - revolutionized how information is consumed.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Steve had rightly said - "<i><b>Death is the destination we all share...</b></i>"</span><br /><br />If I can relate one person in the history with Steve it would be - <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" style="color: blue;">Leonardo da Vinci</a></b>. Both were multi talented - be in the field of creativity, design, passion, innovation, vision, foresight..<br /><br /><b><i>May his soul rest in peace...</i></b><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9675872-7067544320468287132?l=bnagur.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
