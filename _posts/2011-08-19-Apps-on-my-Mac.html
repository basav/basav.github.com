It has been a almost 3 months I switched to Mac using it full time for development and day to day usage. It has been an awesome experience.<br />During this period, I have installed and uninstalled many tools.<br />Below are some of the best productivity tools that I'm currently using which surely make the development experience a memorable one.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>&nbsp; - the best Terminal - must have<br /><a href="http://www.producteev.com/developers/">Producteev</a> - The Ultimate Free Task Management Solution. Check it out. It even sends reminders of the late tasks, very intuitive to use<br /><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> - makes searching the Mac a breeze. A good alternative for spotlight, lots of features for customization<br /><a href="http://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/sophos-antivirus-for-mac-home-edition.aspx">Sophos</a>&nbsp; Free Antivirus for Mac.
